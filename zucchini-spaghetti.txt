This recipe is a cross between spaghetti and salad. It is one of my favorite ways to eat spiralized zucchini.

Makes one serving

2 or 3 fresh mushrooms
1/2-3/4 t spike seasoning
a small amount of butter and oil for sauteing
1 zucchini
1 roma tomato
1 carrot
a few fresh basil leaves (optional)
salt (if using unsalted spike)
parmesan cheese
pre-made spaghetti sauce
turkey pepperoni (optional)

Melt butter and heat oil over medium high heat. Slice mushrooms. Add mushrooms, salt and spike. Saute until mushrooms soak up the oil and spices. Set aside. These contain the major salt, butter and spices of the recipe, so the mushrooms act as little flavor packets that spread throughout the dish for extra yumminess. 

Spiralize the zucchini on the smallest setting to make thin noodles. They can be eaten raw, or if you prefer, microwave them for 1 1/2 min and drain. Or boil, bake, steam or pan fry. Place into a serving bowl.

Chop the tomato. Grate or finely shred the carrot. Chope the basil leaves, if using. Add each to the bowl.

Heat up spaghetti sauce.

Top with spaghetti sauce, parmesan cheese and optional turkey pepperoni.
Serve like spaghetti.
